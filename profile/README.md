# Orbit

Orbit is a platform for booking safe, platonic social experiences through modern web and mobile applications.

## What we’re building

- **Safe, platonic experiences**: real-world activities with clear expectations and trust-oriented UX.
- **End-to-end product**: discovery → booking → payments → messaging → schedules.
- **Modern platform**: API-first backend + mobile + web + internal admin tooling.
